## Requirements

### The Model 
* [x] (10 points) a very simplified version of your classes 

### The View
* [x] (15 points) allow the user to enter information required to create an object 

* [x] (10 points) use at least one control that is different from a TextField (e.g., a radio button, check box, combo box, etc.) 

* [x] (5 points) have a button to display information about the object (or a collection of objects- you can decide if the user will enter one object or multiple objects)  

* [x] (5 points) have a button to display the results of "processing" an object (or a collection of objects) 
  * "processing" will be an action defined by one of your class-specific methods

### The Controller

* [x] (20 points) create the objects (using the classes of the model) using the data entered by the user (via the view) 

* [x] (20 points) define the methods that will respond to the button clicks of the view

* [x] (15 points) display/process the objects when necessary and return the output to the view
